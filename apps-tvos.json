            "en": "Kodi is an award-winning free and open source software media player and entertainment hub for digital media. Available as a native application for Android, Linux, BSD, macOS, iOS, tvOS and Windows operating systems, Kodi runs on most common processor architectures. \n Created in 2003 by a group of like minded programmers, Kodi is a non-profit project run by the XBMC Foundation and developed by volunteers located around the world. More than 500 software developers have contributed to Kodi to date, and 100-plus translators have worked to expand its reach, making it available in more than 70 languages. \n While Kodi functions very well as a standard media player application for your computer, it has been designed to be the perfect companion for your HTPC. With its beautiful interface and powerful skinning engine, Kodi feels very natural to use from the couch with a remote control and is the ideal solution for your home theater."
